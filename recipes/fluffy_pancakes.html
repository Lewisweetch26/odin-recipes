    <p>Looking for a fluffy pancake recipe? This one is just right! Topped with syrup or strawberries and whipped cream, they are impossible to resist.</p>
<h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
<ul>
    <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>
<ol>
    <li>Combine milk with vinegar in a medium bowl and set aside for 5 minutes to "sour".</li>
    <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whisk egg and butter into "soured" milk. Pour the flour mixture into the milk mixture and whisk until lumps are gone.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat, and coat it with cooking spray. Pour 1/4 cupfuls of batter onto the skillet, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip with a spatula, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
